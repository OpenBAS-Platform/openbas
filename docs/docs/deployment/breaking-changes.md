## OpenAEV 2.2.0

### Introduction

<a id="octi-oaev-compatibility"></a>

#### Scenario generation from OpenCTI security coverage

In **OpenAEV 2.2.0**, the interconnection between OpenCTI and OpenAEV requires matching major versions:

- **OpenAEV 2.2.0** only works with **OpenCTI V7**
- **OpenCTI V7** only works with **OpenAEV 2.2.0**

Due to API and interconnection changes introduced in OpenCTI V7, previous versions of OpenCTI are not compatible
with OpenAEV 2.2.0, and conversely, OpenCTI V7 is not compatible with earlier versions of OpenAEV.

!!! success "Resolved in OpenAEV 2.2.1"

    Backwards compatibility with older OpenCTI versions has been restored starting from **OpenAEV 2.2.1**. This breaking change only affects **OpenAEV 2.2.0**.

If you are upgrading to OpenAEV 2.2.0, please make sure to upgrade both OpenCTI and OpenAEV simultaneously to avoid service disruption.

For more details, see [this migration guide](breaking-changes/2.2.0-opencti-security-coverage.md)

## OpenAEV 2.1.0

### Introduction

<a id="openaev-encryption"></a>
#### OpenAEV encryption

With the introduction of the OpenAEV catalog, built-in connectors now store their configuration in the database. To
ensure security, secrets and passwords within these configurations must be encrypted. This requires two new mandatory
properties to be configured.

For more details, see [this migration guide](breaking-changes/2.1.0-encrypting-password.md)

## OpenAEV 2.0.0

### Deprecation

<a id="openaev-renaming"></a>

#### OpenAEV renaming

Following the evolution of scope in OpenBAS (Open Breach & Attack Simulation), it was decided to rename the project to
OpenAEV (Open Adversarial Exposure Validation).

This platform allows you to entirely create custom attack scenarios to emulate on endpoints. You can even create your
own automated tabletop crisis simulation.

All those changes require manual modifications to upgrade from previous versions of OpenBAS, even if a lot have been
automated.

Take note that the first startup can be longer, all modifications have to be applied, and it can take a bit longer than
usual.

For more details, see [this migration guide](breaking-changes/2.0.0-openaev-renaming.md)

## OpenAEV 2.3.4

### Introduction

<a id="openaev-csrf"></a>

#### OpenAEV CSRF protection for frontend API calls

Starting with **OpenAEV 2.3.4**, frontend-initiated API calls must include a valid CSRF token.  
To prevent API authentication and connection issues, make sure all ecosystem components are upgraded to versions compatible with OpenAEV 2.3.4.

For more details, see [this migration guide](breaking-changes/2.3.4-csrf-token-enforcement.md)

## OpenAEV 2.260622.0

### Introduction

<a id="url-access-token-enforcement"></a>

#### URL access token enforcement for email links

Starting with **OpenAEV 2.260622.0**, OpenAEV no longer accepts legacy email links based on `userId` and `user` query parameters for player access flows.

OpenAEV now requires token-based links using `/url/access?token=<raw-token>`, followed by a secure cookie and redirect flow.

For more details, see [this migration guide](breaking-changes/2.260622.0-url-access-token-enforcement.md)

## OpenAEV \[MigrationVersion\]

### Introduction

<a id="injector-contract-expectation-format"></a>

#### Injector contract expectation format

Starting with **OpenAEV \[MigrationVersion\]**, the `predefinedExpectations` list in `injector_contract_content` has been removed. All expectations are now under a single `availableExpectations` list, each with an `expectation_is_predefined` flag.

For more details, see [this migration guide](breaking-changes/MigrationVersion-injector-contract-expectation-format.md)

<a id="tenant-users-groups-and-roles-capabilities"></a>

#### Tenant users, groups and roles capabilities

Starting with **OpenAEV \[MigrationVersion\]**, managing a tenant's users, groups and roles is governed by its own *Access / Manage / Delete tenant users, groups and roles* capabilities, instead of the *tenant settings* ones which also cover collectors, injectors and tag rules. Existing roles are migrated automatically and keep the access they had.

For more details, see [this migration guide](breaking-changes/MigrationVersion-tenant-users-groups-and-roles-capabilities.md)

<a id="elasticsearch-9"></a>

#### Elasticsearch 9

Starting with **OpenAEV \[MigrationVersion\]**, the platform requires an Elasticsearch 9 cluster. The 9.x client
tags its requests as `compatible-with=9`, which an 8.x server rejects, so every engine call fails against
Elasticsearch 8. OpenSearch deployments are unaffected.

For more details, see [this migration guide](breaking-changes/MigrationVersion-elasticsearch-9.md)
