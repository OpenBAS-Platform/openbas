# Executors

## Introduction

To be able to use the power of the OpenAEV platform on endpoints, you need at least one **neutral executor** that will
be in charge of executing implants as detached processes. Implants will then execute Threat Arsenal Actions.

The platform manages different executors which can be installed on Windows, Linux and MacOS using x86_64 or arm64
architectures. This table below summarizes the information about each agent.

| Executor                           | Type          | Installation mode                                 | Installation type | Run As                                 | Threat arsenal action execution                | Multi agents for an endpoint                     |

## OpenAEV Agent

The OpenAEV agent is available for Windows, Linux and MacOS, it is the native / default way to execute implants and
Threat Arsenal Actions on endpoints.

<a id="tanium-agent"></a>

## Tanium Agent

The Tanium agent can be leveraged to execute implants as detached processes that will then execute threat arsenal
actions, according
to the [OpenAEV architecture](https://docs.openaev.io/latest/deployment/platform/overview/).

### Configure the Tanium platform

We
provide [two Tanium packages](https://github.com/OpenAEV-Platform/openaev/blob/master/openaev-api/src/main/java/io/openaev/executors/tanium/openaev-tanium-packages.json)
to be imported into the Tanium platform.

![Tanium Packages](../assets/tanium-packages.png)

!!! warning "Tanium package configuration"

    Because OpenAEV should run implants as detached processes, you must uncheck  
    **"Launch this package command in a process group"** in the package configuration:

    ![Tanium Package](../assets/tanium-package.png)

!!! warning "Tanium Threat Response usage"

    If your environment uses **Tanium Threat Response (TTR)** together with the Tanium agent, you should rely on the **dedicated TTR package**.  
    This package technically works in all cases, but it is **only recommended** when OpenAEV runs on endpoints with TTR enabled.  
    Reason: this package performs more extensive operations on the machine and can generate **more noise and alerts**.  
    If you do **not** use Tanium Threat Response, prefer the **standard Tanium package**.

    **Packages to import:**

    - [OpenAEV Tanium Windows & Unix package (TTR)](https://github.com/OpenAEV-Platform/openaev/blob/master/openaev-api/src/main/java/io/openaev/executors/tanium/openaev-tanium-packages-TTR.json)

    **Scripts to attach in the package configuration into files section:**

    - [Windows TTR script](https://github.com/OpenAEV-Platform/openaev/blob/master/openaev-api/src/main/java/io/openaev/executors/tanium/openaev-ttr.ps1)
    - [Linux & macOS TTR script](https://github.com/OpenAEV-Platform/openaev/blob/master/openaev-api/src/main/java/io/openaev/executors/tanium/openaev-ttr.sh)

| Package type                | Recommended use case                  | Characteristics                                            |
|-----------------------------|---------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Standard Tanium package** | Default use with Tanium agent only    | Lightweight, minimal impact, recommended in most scenarios |
| **TTR package**             | Tanium agent + Tanium Threat Response | Enables additional operations, may generate more noise     |

Once configured and imported, retrieve the package IDs from the URL:  
`ui/console/packages/XXXXX/preview`.

!!! note "Common group IDs in Tanium"

    - **Computer Group ID**: identifies which endpoints will be queried.
    - **Action Group ID**: identifies where actions (like package execution) are allowed.

### Configure the OpenAEV platform

To configure the Tanium executor, navigate to the **Integrations > Executors** section in the OpenAEV menu and fill in the Tanium integration settings directly from the UI.

!!! note "Tanium API Key"

    The Tanium API key must have permissions to:  
    - Retrieve the endpoint list from the Tanium GraphQL API  
    - Launch packages on endpoints  

!!! info "Migrating from environment variables"

    If you previously configured this executor using environment variables or platform properties, these values have been **automatically migrated** to the database on first startup. After migration, changes to environment variables or properties are no longer taken into account — all configuration is now managed through the UI.

### Checks

Once enabled, you should see **Tanium** available in the `Install agents` section:

![Agents](../assets/agents.png)

Endpoints from the selected computer groups should now appear in the **OpenAEV Endpoints** section:

![Endpoints](../assets/tanium-endpoints.png)

!!! note "Agent uniqueness"

    An endpoint can only have **one Tanium agent** registered due to MAC (Media Access Control) address uniqueness.
    Installing a new agent will overwrite the existing one, and you will always see a single endpoint in the OpenAEV console.

!!! success "Installation done"

    You are now ready to leverage your Tanium platform to run OpenAEV Threat Arsenal Actions!

## CrowdStrike Falcon Agent

The CrowdStrike Falcon agent can be leveraged to execute implants as detached processes that will then execute threat
arsenal actions
according to the [OpenAEV architecture](https://docs.openaev.io/latest/deployment/platform/overview/).

### Configure the CrowdStrike platform

#### Upload OpenAEV scripts

First of all, you need to create two custom scripts, one for Windows and one for Unix, covering both Linux and MacOS
systems.

To create it, go to `Host setup and management` > `Response and containment` > `Response scripts and files`. The names
of the scripts can be changed if necessary, they will be put in the OpenAEV configuration.

*Unix Script*

| Attribute             | Value                                                            |

| script access         | Users with the role of RTR (Real Time Response) Administrator or RTR Active Responder |
| shared with workflows | yes                                                              |

Put the following script:

```bash
command=`echo $1 | grep -o '"command":"[^"]*' | grep -o '[^"]*$'`
echo $command | base64 -d | sh
```

Put the following Input schema:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12/schema",
  "properties": {

}
```

![CrowdStrike windows script](../assets/crowdstrike-windows-script.png)

Once created, your RTR scripts should have something like this:

![CrowdStrike RTR script](../assets/crowdstrike-scripts.png)

#### Create a host group with your targeted assets

To create a host group, go to `Host setup and management` > `Host groups`.

#### Create/update response policies for your targeted platforms

As OpenAEV will ask CrowdStrike to create implants in order to execute Threat Arsenal Actions as scripts, you need to
allow the
execution of custom scripts on your assets. To do so, you need to create a new response policy or update an existing one
for your assets' platforms.

To create or update a response policy, go to `Host setup and management` > `Response policies`.

There, choose a platform in the top left selector, then click on `Create policy` or click on the name of an existing
one.
![CrowdStrike Response Policies](../assets/crowdstrike-windows-policies.png)

The CrowdStrike UI should present you with a screen like this:
![CrowdStrike Response Policies Details](../assets/crowdstrike-windows-policy.png)

On this screen, click to allow `Custom Scripts` execution.
If an option named `Falcon Scripts` exists, allow it as well.
For the other options, you can choose to allow or deny them according to your security policy and what you want to test.
Click on `Save` to save your changes.

Finally, click on the `Assigned host groups` tab to add your previously created group to this policy.
Once done, the policy may take a few minutes to be applied to your assets.
You can go back to the policies list screen and check that there is a 0 in the `Pending` column to know that it has been
applied.

### Configure the OpenAEV platform

!!! warning "CrowdStrike API Key"

    Please note that the CrowdStrike API key should have the following permissions: API integrations, Hosts, Host groups, Real time response.

To configure the CrowdStrike executor, navigate to the **Integrations > Executors** section in the OpenAEV menu and fill in the CrowdStrike integration settings directly from the UI.

!!! info "Migrating from environment variables"

    If you previously configured this executor using environment variables or platform properties, these values have been **automatically migrated** to the database on first startup. After migration, changes to environment variables or properties are no longer taken into account — all configuration is now managed through the UI.

### Checks

Once enabled, you should see CrowdStrike available in your `Install agents` section

![CrowdStrike available agent](../assets/agents.png)

Also, the assets and the asset groups in the selected computer groups should now be available in the endpoints and asset
groups sections in OpenAEV:

![CrowdStrike Endpoints](../assets/crowdstrike-endpoints.png)

NB : An Asset can only have one CrowdStrike agent installed due to the uniqueness of the MAC address parameters. If you
try to install again a CrowdStrike agent on a platform, it will overwrite the actual one and you will always see one
Endpoint on the OpenAEV endpoint page.

!!! success "Installation done"

    You are now ready to leverage your CrowdStrike platform to run OpenAEV Threat Arsenal Actions!

## Palo Alto Cortex Agent

The Palo Alto Cortex agent can be leveraged to execute implants as detached processes that will then execute threat
arsenal actions
according to the [OpenAEV architecture](https://docs.openaev.io/latest/deployment/platform/overview/).

On Windows, because Palo Alto Cortex whitelists its own process tree, OpenAEV creates a scheduled task to detach the
process that will execute the Threat Arsenal Actions.

### Configure the Palo Alto Cortex platform

#### Upload OpenAEV scripts

First of all, you need to create one custom script for Unix, covering both Linux and MacOS systems and another one for
Windows.

To create these scripts, go to `Investigation & responses` > `Action Center` > `Agent Script Library` > `+ New Script`.
The names
of the scripts can be changed if necessary, the ids will be put in the OpenAEV configuration.
To get the scripts IDs, it may be necessary to add the Script UID column to the scripts list view.

*Unix Script*

Upload the following Python script:

[Download](../assets/paloaltocortex_subprocessor_unix.py)

To create a group, go to `Inventory` > `Endpoints` > `Groups`.

### Configure the OpenAEV platform

!!! warning "Palo Alto Cortex API Key"

    Please note that the Palo Alto Cortex API key created in **Settings > Configurations > API Keys** should have the following minimum role: "Instance Administrator" and security level: "Standard".

To configure the Palo Alto Cortex executor, navigate to the **Integrations > Executors** section in the OpenAEV menu and fill in the Palo Alto Cortex integration settings directly from the UI.

### Checks

Once enabled, you should see Palo Alto Cortex available in your `Install agents` section

## SentinelOne Agent

The SentinelOne agent can be leveraged to execute implants as detached processes that will then execute threat arsenal
actions
according to the [OpenAEV architecture](https://docs.openaev.io/latest/deployment/platform/overview/).

!!! warning "SentinelOne"

    Please note that the SentinelOne license with add-on "remote script orchestration" is required to launch SentinelOne scripts with OpenAEV. See **SentinelOne > Settings > Configuration > Add-ons**.

### Configure the SentinelOne platform

#### Upload OpenAEV scripts

First of all, you need to create two custom scripts, one for Windows and one for Unix, covering both Linux and MacOS
systems.

To create it, go to `Automation` > `Remote Ops` > `Create new`. The names
of the scripts can be changed if necessary, the ids will be put in the OpenAEV configuration.

## Microsoft Defender for Endpoint (MDE) Agent

Microsoft Defender for Endpoint (MDE) can be leveraged to execute implants as detached processes that will then execute
Threat Arsenal Actions according to
the [OpenAEV architecture](https://docs.openaev.io/latest/deployment/platform/overview/).

OpenAEV does **not** install a new agent: it reuses the **MDE sensor already deployed** on your endpoints and drives it
through the **Live Response** API. For each inject, OpenAEV runs a small subprocessor script from the MDE Live Response
Library, which downloads and starts the OpenAEV implant.

!!! info "Enterprise Edition"

    The Microsoft Defender for Endpoint executor is an **Enterprise Edition** feature. A valid EE license is required to
    enable it.

!!! warning "Windows: detached scheduled task"

    On Windows, the MDE Live Response session terminates the whole process tree when the session ends. To let the implant
    survive and report its execution traces, OpenAEV launches it from a **detached SYSTEM scheduled task**
    (`OpenAEV-Inject-<inject>-Agent-<agent>`). This task **self-deletes** right after the implant finishes — you should
    not see leftover tasks in Task Scheduler.

### Configure the Microsoft Defender platform

#### 1. Register an Azure (Entra ID) application

OpenAEV authenticates to the MDE API with the OAuth2 **client credentials** flow. Create an app registration in
**Microsoft Entra ID > App registrations > New registration**, then collect:

- **Directory (tenant) ID** → `Azure tenant ID` in OpenAEV
- **Application (client) ID** → `Client ID` in OpenAEV
- A **client secret** (`Certificates & secrets > New client secret`) → `Client secret` in OpenAEV

![MDE app registration](../assets/mde-app-registration.png)

![MDE client secret](../assets/mde-client-secret.png)

!!! warning "Required API permissions"

    Under **API permissions**, add the following **Application permissions** for *WindowsDefenderATP*, then click
    **Grant admin consent**:

    | Permission | Why |
    |------------|-----|
    | `Machine.Read.All` | List devices (and read their device-group name/id) and sync them into OpenAEV |
    | `Machine.LiveResponse.All` | Run the Live Response script that launches the implant |
    | `AdvancedQuery.Read.All` | Read near real-time device activity (Advanced Hunting) so only genuinely-reachable machines are marked active — the device inventory `lastSeen` lags by up to a day |

    Application permissions (not delegated) are mandatory because OpenAEV runs without a signed-in user.

![MDE API permissions](../assets/mde-api-permissions.png)

#### 2. Enable Live Response in Microsoft Defender

In the **Microsoft Defender portal > Settings > Endpoints > Advanced features**, enable:

- **Live Response** (required)
- **Live Response for servers** (only if you target Windows Server / Linux server endpoints)
- **Live Response unsigned script execution** (**required** — the OpenAEV subprocessor scripts are not code-signed)

!!! danger "Unsigned script execution"

    If *Live Response unsigned script execution* is **disabled**, every inject fails at the Live Response step because
    MDE refuses to run the OpenAEV subprocessor script. This is the single most common misconfiguration.

![MDE Live Response advanced features](../assets/mde-live-response-features.png)

#### 3. Upload the OpenAEV subprocessor scripts

Upload the two subprocessor scripts to the **MDE Live Response Library** (they decode the Base64 command sent by OpenAEV
and execute it). The file names must match what you configure in OpenAEV (defaults below).

*Windows script* (`openaev-subprocessor.ps1`):

[Download](../assets/mde_subprocessor_windows.ps1)

*Unix script* (`openaev-subprocessor.sh`, covers Linux and macOS):

[Download](../assets/mde_subprocessor_unix.sh)

!!! note "How the scripts work"

    OpenAEV passes the full command as a **single Base64 argument**. The Windows script decodes it and runs it with
    `Invoke-Expression`; the Unix script decodes it and pipes it to `sh`. Keep them as-is — reserved parameter names such
    as `param([string]$Args)` will break argument passing on PowerShell (`$args[0]` must be used).

!!! warning "Tick *Has parameters* when uploading each script"

    In the upload dialog, **enable the "parameters" option** for both scripts. OpenAEV always invokes the subprocessor
    with the Base64 command as an argument; if parameters are not enabled, MDE runs the script without it and every inject
    fails. Both scripts must show **Has parameters: Yes** in the library.

![MDE Live Response Library](../assets/mde-scripts-library.png)

#### 4. (Optional) Scope to a device group

To sync only a subset of devices, set the **device group ID** (`rbacGroupId`) in OpenAEV. Leave the field empty to
sync **all** devices.

!!! warning "The numeric `rbacGroupId` is not shown in the Microsoft Defender UI"

    The Defender portal (**Settings > Endpoints > Permissions > Device groups**) shows device group **names**, not the
    numeric `rbacGroupId` that OpenAEV needs. The MDE API also exposes no "list device groups" endpoint. The reliable way
    to map a group **name** to its **id** is to read it from the machines inventory, which returns both `rbacGroupName`
    and `rbacGroupId` for every device.

![MDE device groups](../assets/mde-device-groups.png)

Run the following (PowerShell) against your tenant — it authenticates with the same Entra app registration and prints
the `name → id` mapping for every device group that has at least one machine:

```powershell
$tenant = '<TENANT_ID>'
$client = '<CLIENT_ID>'
$secret = '<CLIENT_SECRET>'

$token = (Invoke-RestMethod -Method Post `
  -Uri "https://login.microsoftonline.com/$tenant/oauth2/v2.0/token" `
  -Body @{
    grant_type    = 'client_credentials'
    client_id     = $client
    client_secret = $secret
    scope         = 'https://api.securitycenter.microsoft.com/.default'
  }).access_token

$machines = Invoke-RestMethod `
  -Uri 'https://api.securitycenter.microsoft.com/api/machines?$select=rbacGroupId,rbacGroupName' `
  -Headers @{ Authorization = "Bearer $token" }

$machines.value |
  Select-Object rbacGroupName, rbacGroupId -Unique |
  Sort-Object rbacGroupName |
  Format-Table -AutoSize
```

Example output:

```text
rbacGroupName   rbacGroupId
-------------   -----------
DEMO                    367
UnassignedGroup         366
```

![MDE rbacGroupId lookup result](../assets/mde-rbacgroupid-result.png)

Here, syncing only the **DEMO** group means setting the OpenAEV **Device group** field to `367`. Separate multiple IDs
with commas (for example `367,366`). `UnassignedGroup` is the default group for machines not assigned to any custom
group.

!!! note "The `$select` query above requires quoting"

    Keep the URI in **single quotes** so PowerShell does not interpret `$select` as a variable. The app registration
    needs `Machine.Read.All` (already granted in step 1). A group appears only once it contains at least one machine that
    MDE has seen.

### Configure the OpenAEV platform

To configure the MDE executor, navigate to the **Integrations > Executors** section in the OpenAEV menu and fill in the
Microsoft Defender for Endpoint integration settings directly from the UI.

![MDE executor configuration in OpenAEV](../assets/mde-executor-config.png)

| Field | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| **Azure tenant ID** | ✅ | Directory (tenant) ID of the Entra app registration |
| **Client ID** | ✅ | Application (client) ID |
| **Client secret** | ✅ | Client secret value |
| **Device group** | ❌ | One or more `rbacGroupId` separated by commas. Empty = all devices |
| **Windows script name** | ✅ | Must match the uploaded Windows script (default `openaev-subprocessor.ps1`) |
| **Unix script name** | ✅ | Must match the uploaded Unix script (default `openaev-subprocessor.sh`) |

!!! note "Advanced settings"

    Defaults rarely need changing: the API base URL (`https://api.securitycenter.microsoft.com/api`), the auth URL
    (`https://login.microsoftonline.com`), the register interval (device/agent sync, default **1200s**) and the Live
    Response batch pagination (**10 machines / 5s**, the MDE rate limit is stricter than CrowdStrike).

![MDE executor advanced options](../assets/mde-executor-advanced.png)

### Checks

Once enabled, you should see Microsoft Defender for Endpoint available in your `Install agents` section.

The devices in the selected device group(s) should now appear in the endpoints and asset groups sections in OpenAEV
after the first sync (up to the register interval).

![MDE assets in OpenAEV](../assets/mde-assets.png)

!!! note "Where to see executions on the Microsoft side"

    Each inject is an MDE **Live Response** action. You can review them in the Microsoft Defender portal:

    - **Assets > Devices > *device* > Timeline** and the device **Live response** session log
    - **Action center > History**, filtered on *Action type = Live response* / *Source = API*
    - **Advanced hunting** (KQL (Kusto Query Language) on `DeviceProcessEvents`) to see the scheduled task, the implant and the payload commands

!!! success "Installation done"

    You are now ready to leverage your Microsoft Defender for Endpoint platform to run OpenAEV Threat Arsenal Actions!

#### Microsoft Defender for Endpoint — troubleshooting

!!! tip "Inject is ERROR but I have execution traces (stdout/stderr)"

    This is expected: the inject status reflects the **payload's own exit code / stderr**, not an executor failure. If the
    payload command returns a non-zero exit code or writes to `stderr` (e.g. running `net localgroup "Administrators"` on a
    non-English Windows, or a test designed to fail off-domain), the trace is marked ERROR even though the executor
    delivered and ran it correctly. Check the `stdout`/`stderr`/`exit_code` in the execution trace to confirm.

!!! tip "Inject stays PENDING then TIMEOUT (no trace)"

    The implant was likely killed when the Live Response session ended. Ensure you are running a recent OpenAEV version
    (the implant runs from a **self-deleting SYSTEM scheduled task** on Windows). Check Task Scheduler while an inject runs:
    a task `OpenAEV-Inject-...` should appear briefly, then disappear.

!!! tip "\"Agent not found\" / \"Element not found\" on callback"

    OpenAEV resolves the calling agent by its **MDE Device ID**. A device that was re-provisioned or manually deleted can
    leave a stale agent whose primary key no longer matches the Device ID. Let a sync cycle run (or restart the platform)
    so the device is re-registered with the correct Device ID before relaunching.

!!! tip "Live Response fails immediately for every device"

    Verify **Live Response unsigned script execution** is enabled (see step 2), that both subprocessor scripts are in the
    Live Response Library with the **exact names** configured in OpenAEV, and that the app registration has
    `Machine.LiveResponse.All` with **admin consent granted**.

!!! tip "Devices are missing or show as inactive"

    OpenAEV filters devices by the configured **device group** and marks an agent active from **near
    real-time Advanced Hunting activity** (the device inventory `lastSeen` lags by up to a day and is
    not reliable). If the app registration lacks `AdvancedQuery.Read.All`, OpenAEV falls back to the
    sensor `healthStatus` and logs a warning. Confirm the device group ID, that the machines are
    onboarded and reporting to MDE, and that `AdvancedQuery.Read.All` is granted.

!!! tip "An inject times out on a device that looks active"

    Live Response only runs while the Defender sensor is **actively connected**. A device can be
    onboarded and healthy yet asleep/offline right now: the `runliveresponse` action is then created
    but stays **Pending** until the machine reconnects, so the inject times out. This is an inherent
    MDE constraint (one Live Response session per machine, no execution while offline), not an OpenAEV
    error. Stale Pending actions are cancelled automatically before the next dispatch so they never
    block future injects.

## Caldera Agent

The Caldera agent can be leveraged to execute implants as detached processes that will then execute threat arsenal
actions according to
the [OpenAEV architecture](https://docs.openaev.io/latest/deployment/platform/overview/).

!!! note "Caldera already installed"

    If you already have a working Caldera installation, just go directly to [OpenAEV configuration section](#openaev-configuration).

### Deploy Caldera

To deploy Caldera, you can just add Caldera to the OpenAEV stack, we advise you to modify your `docker-compose.yml` and
add a [Caldera service](https://github.com/OpenAEV-Platform/caldera/blob/filigran/docker/docker-compose.yml):

```
services:
  caldera:
    image: openaev/caldera-server:5.1.0
    restart: always
    ports:
      - "8888:8888"
    environment:
      CALDERA_URL: http://localhost:8888
    volumes:
      - type: bind
        source: caldera.yml
        target: /usr/src/app/conf/local.yml
```

As you can see in the configuration, you will also need a configuration
file [caldera.yml](https://github.com/OpenAEV-Platform/caldera/blob/filigran/docker/caldera.yml) because Caldera does
not support well environment variables for configuration.

Download [caldera.yml](https://github.com/OpenAEV-Platform/caldera/blob/filigran/docker/caldera.yml) and put it
alongside your `docker-compose.yml` file. This file must be modified prior launching, only change what is marked as *
*Change this**, listed below.

```yaml
users:
  red:
    red: ChangeMe                                                                     # Change this
  blue:
    blue: ChangeMe                                                                    # Change this
api_key_red: ChangeMe                                                                 # Change this
api_key_blue: ChangeMe                                                                # Change this
api_key: ChangeMe                                                                     # Change this
crypt_salt: ChangeMe                                                                  # Change this
encryption_key: ChangeMe                                                              # Change this
app.contact.http: http://caldera.myopenaev.myorganization.com:8888                    # Change this
app.contact.tunnel.ssh.user_password: ChangeMe                                        # Change this
```

Just update your stack and check Caldera is running:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

### OpenAEV configuration

To configure the Caldera executor, navigate to the **Integrations > Executors** section in the OpenAEV menu and fill in the Caldera integration settings directly from the UI.

!!! info "Migrating from environment variables"

    If you previously configured this executor using environment variables or platform properties, these values have been **automatically migrated** to the database on first startup. After migration, changes to environment variables or properties are no longer taken into account — all configuration is now managed through the UI.

### Agents

#### Deploy agents

Once enabled, you should see Caldera available in your `Install agents` section:

OpenAEV has built-in instruction if you want command line examples to deploy the agent on one endpoint.

![Caldera deploy agents](../assets/caldera-deploy-agent.png)

!!! warning "Caldera AV (antivirus) detection"

    By default, the Caldera agent "Sandcat" is detected and blocked by antivirus. Here, we are using Caldera as a neutral executor that will execute implants that will execute Threat Arsenal Actions, so you need to add the proper AV exclusions as instructed in the OpenAEV screen.

    ![Caldera AV exclusion](../assets/caldera-av.png)

#### Checks

All assets with a proper Caldera agent installed using the OpenAEV provided command line (then persistent) should now be
available in the OpenAEV endpoints list.

![Endpoints](../assets/caldera-endpoints.png)

#### Uninstallation

Run the following commands with an administrator Powershell in order to uninstall your Caldera agent:<br/>
`schtasks /delete /tn OpenAEVCaldera`<br/>
`Stop-Process -Name oaev-agent-caldera`<br/>
`rm -force -Recurse "C:\Program Files (x86)\Filigran\OAEV Caldera"`

## Implant directories and cleanup
For all executors (except Caldera and OpenAEV Agent) :

### Implant directories
Implants are downloaded into a `runtimes/implant-XXXXX` subdirectory relative to the agent's installation directory, where `XXXXX` is a unique UUID generated for each inject execution.

Each implant directory is unique per inject.

The installation directory path varies depending on the agent type and installation mode. Refer to [installation mode](../../usage/environment/openaev-agent.md#privileges-security_1) for the exact paths.

### Cleanup
Old implant directories are periodically cleaned up by the platform. At the interval defined by `clean-implant-interval` (default: **8 hours**), the platform sends a cleanup command to each endpoint agent to remove directories in `runtimes/` and `payloads/` that are older than **24 hours**.

!!! note "OpenAEV Agent"

    The OpenAEV Agent has its own built-in garbage collector with different thresholds. See the [OpenAEV Agent documentation](../../usage/environment/openaev-agent.md) for details.

## Troubleshooting

When an inject fails to execute on an endpoint, follow this 5-step diagnostic process.
This procedure applies to all EDR (Endpoint Detection and Response)-based executors (CrowdStrike, Palo Alto Cortex, etc.).

### Step 1 — Run the inject from OpenAEV

Trigger the inject normally from the OpenAEV platform and wait for it to reach a **failed** or **timeout** state.

### Step 2 — Check the executor for an execution trace

Navigate to the executor console and look for a trace of the execution attempt.

!!! note "Executor-dependent"
    The availability of an execution trace depends on the executor. See the [per-executor sections below](#per-executor-how-to-find-the-execution-trace).

- ✅ **Trace found** → proceed to Step 3
- ❌ **No trace** → the issue is upstream: check connectivity, API credentials, whether the endpoint agent is properly registered in the executor platform, whether the script/payload pushed to the executor is correct, or whether the executor itself is misconfigured

### Step 3 — Retrieve the command

In the executor console, locate and copy the exact command that was pushed by OpenAEV.

### Step 4 — Decode and inspect the command

!!! warning "First potential failure point"
    The command may appear valid in the executor but fail silently due to encoding issues invisible at the platform level.

EDR-based executors use a Base64-encoded payload. Decode it before inspecting.

Once decoded, verify:

- Paths are correct for the target OS
- Parameters are well-formed
- No escaping or encoding issues are present

### Step 5 — Execute the command directly on the endpoint

!!! warning "Second potential failure point"
    Running the command manually on the endpoint isolates whether the failure is in the delivery layer or the command itself.

Connect to the target endpoint via CLI and run the decoded command directly. Capture the **full CLI output** — this is the most actionable error information for diagnosis.
