# Overview

Before starting the installation, let's discover how OpenAEV is working, which dependencies are needed and what are the
minimal requirements to deploy it in production.

    If you're looking for information about the deployment of the full eXtended Threat Management (XTM) suite using Docker, please refer [to this repository and documentation](https://github.com/FiligranHQ/xtm-docker).

## Architecture

The OpenAEV platform relies on several external databases and services in order to work.

### Platform

Platform is the central component, allowing users to configure scenarios, simulations, atomic testings and all other
components used in the context of security validations.

### Neutral agents / executors

Executors are responsible to launch simulated attacks on endpoints.

We developed our own XTM agent and also support third-party agents, with more being added over time.

!!! tip "Tips"

      If you want to learn more about how to deploy executors, you can have more info [here](../ecosystem/executors.md).

### Injectors

Injectors are used to interact with third-party applications or services (including execution on the endpoints through
executors) in the context of a simulation or an atomic testing. A few injectors are built-in but most of them are
standalone Python processes.

      If you want to learn more about how to deploy injectors, you can have more info [here](../ecosystem/injectors.md).

### Collectors

Collectors are used to connect to all security systems such as SIEMs (Security Information and Event Management), XDRs (Extended Detection and Response), EDRs (Endpoint Detection and Response), firewalls, mail gateways etc. to check
if an inject (execution, emails, etc.) has been detected or prevented and fill the security posture.

## Infrastructure requirements

### Dependencies

| Component     | Recommended version             | CPU     | RAM     | Disk type | Disk space |
|:--------------|:--------------------------------|:--------|:--------|:----------|:-----------|
| PostgreSQL    | ≥ 17.0                          | 2 cores | ≥ 8GB   | SSD       | ≥ 16GB     |
| ElasticSearch | ≥ 9.0                           | 2 cores | ≥ 8GB   | SSD       | ≥ 16GB     |
| RabbitMQ      | >= 4.1                          | 1 core  | ≥ 512MB | Standard  | ≥ 2GB      |
| S3 / MinIO    | ≥ RELEASE.2025-06-13T11-33-47Z  | 1 core  | ≥ 128MB | SSD       | ≥ 16GB     |

Please note that while the versions of these dependencies are the recommended ones, OpenAEV may still function with
earlier versions. However, we will not provide support for versions prior to the recommended ones.

Elasticsearch is the exception: the platform's client rejects 8.x servers outright, so 9.0 is a hard
minimum. See [this migration guide](../breaking-changes/MigrationVersion-elasticsearch-9.md).

### Platform

| Component     | CPU     | RAM     | Disk type        | Disk space |
|:--------------|:--------|:--------|:-----------------|:-----------|
| OpenAEV  Core | 2 cores | ≥ 8GB   | None (stateless) | -          |
| Injector(s)   | 1 core  | ≥ 128MB | None (stateless) | -          |
| Collector(s)  | 1 core  | ≥ 128MB | None (stateless) | -          |
