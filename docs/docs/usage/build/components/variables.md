# Variables

Variables let you insert dynamic values into Injects so that each Player receives personalized content. OpenAEV provides built-in variables for common fields (email address, exercise name, etc.) and lets you create custom variables for anything else.

## Why use Variables?

- Personalize email and SMS Injects with Player-specific data without duplicating content.
- Define reusable tokens that keep Scenario definitions clean and maintainable.
- Combine variables with FreeMarker list syntax to iterate over Teams or articles.

## Built-in variables

Within certain Injects, you can use a set of predefined built-in variables to dynamically customize content.
Examples of built-in variables include:

- **${user.email}**: Represents the email of the target user
- **${exercise.name}**: Represents the name of the current exercise
- **${player_uri}**: Represents the player interface platform link
- **${teams}**: Represents the list of team name/s for the injection


The list of **available variables** is found in the definition of the Inject:

![Variables section](../../assets/variables_list.png)

## Custom variables

In addition to built-in variables, you can define your own variables within an exercise.

To define custom variables:

1. Select an exercise.
2. Navigate to the **Definition** tab.
3. Navigate to the **Variables** section.

From this section, you can create, update, or delete custom variables.

### Limitations

To create custom variables, consider the following limitation:

- Only lowercase characters and ```_``` are authorized for the key value
- Variable value can only be string

## Use variables

These variables can be used to enhance personalization of certain injects within an exercise.
Here is a non-exhaustive list of concerned injects :
- Email sending
- Sms sending

In case of a list like `articles`, which is a list of articles with properties such as `id`, `name`, and `uri`, or `${teams}`, you could write:

```freemarker
<#list articles as article> - `${article.name}` </#list>
<#list teams as team> `${team}` </#list>
```
