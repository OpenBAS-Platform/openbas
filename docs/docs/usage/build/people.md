# People

People represent the human side of your security posture in OpenAEV. Players, Teams, and Organizations let you organize who participates in [Simulations](../evaluate/simulation/simulation.md) and [Atomic Tests](../evaluate/atomic-testing/atomic-testing.md).

## Why use People?

- Target specific Players or Teams with Injects (phishing emails, manual actions, challenges).
- Measure human response alongside technical detection and prevention.
- Segregate visibility between Organizations so each group only sees its own Players and Teams.

## Players

Players are the users that may take part in your Scenarios, to be tested against attack or contextual events.

Create Players manually with the **+** button at the bottom right, or activate an integration to import them from your IT environment (e.g., Microsoft Entra).

Players are defined by:

- Email address,
- First name,
- Last name,
- Organization: to link a player to an organization (
  see [below](#organizations)),
- Country,
- Phone number: necessary if you want to play SMS Injects,
- PGP (Pretty Good Privacy) public key: necessary if you want to play encrypted email Injects,
- Tags: if you want to sort them by custom categories.

This list of players can be exported by clicking on the export button, at the top right of the players screen.


## Teams

Teams group players into units that can be targeted by injects during simulations or atomic testing. They serve as a way
to represent different security teams (e.g., CSIRT (Computer Security Incident Response Team), SOC (Security Operations Center), VOC (Vulnerability Operations Center)) and other relevant teams that might be involved in your
scenario (e.g., legal department, communication department).

Teams are defined by:

- Name,
- Description,
- Organization: to link a team to an organization (
  see [below](#organizations)),
- Tags: if you want to sort them by custom categories.

From the teams list, you can manage players by clicking on the three-dots inline button on the right and selecting "
Manage players." From there, you can view, update, or delete all the team's players and see their communication
channels' state.


## Organizations

Organization provides a straightforward method to segregate players and teams within the platform. A player associated
with an organization, even with the required rights to animate and planned scenarios and simulations, will never see
players and teams from other organizations.

This feature can be particularly useful if you are using OpenAEV to plan and execute simulations for various companies
or subsidiaries.
