/**
 * Render guard for the three titled wrappers, added WITH the conversion rather
 * than after it.
 *
 * Why it exists: the two guards `check-fds-conformity.mjs` runs look at imports
 * and at hardcoded paddings. Neither can see a header. Nothing else in this
 * suite pins these three wrappers either, so a green gate proves nothing about
 * them — a revert to the product's own uppercase header, or a title that stops
 * reaching the library's slot, would pass every check silently.
 *
 * What is asserted here is STRUCTURE, not computed style: jsdom does not apply
 * the library's stylesheet, so a colour or a font-size read here would be
 * meaningless. The pixel values (12px / 400 / no uppercase / 24px row / 8px
 * gap) are measured in a real browser and recorded in
 * fds-migration/PAPER-GAP-INVENTORY.md — this file guards the wiring that makes
 * those values apply at all.
