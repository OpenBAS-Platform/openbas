/**
 * A finding-driven trigger for a chained step - the sanctioned way to build an attack path that
 * draws itself. Instead of hard-wiring one step after another with {@code parent_step_template_id},
 * a step declares WHAT finding it reacts to ({@code filters}) and WHICH finding values it consumes
 * as inputs ({@code mappings}). The engine then readies it, once per matching finding, against
 * every target that finding pointed at - so a single seed scan fans out onto every
 * host/port/credential it discovers, exactly like a hand-built chained scenario.
 *
 * <p>A step with NO trigger and NO parent is a SEED: it readies immediately against the run scope
 * (e.g. an Nmap sweep). Its output parser emits findings that trigger the finding-driven steps.
