/**
 * Request to create an autonomous (AI-driven) attack-path run. The objective is either free text or
 * derived from an objective template key. The run is fully autonomous: the attack-path substrate is
 * auto-provisioned and the AI orchestrator builds and executes the path itself, so the operator
 * never authors a scenario. An optional name / description only labels the auto-provisioned run.
