/**
 * Single source of truth for masking the secret material the platform discovers during simulations.
 *
 * <p>Sensitivity is <b>derived</b>, never stored: a value is secret because of the type it was
 * extracted as. {@link ChainingTypeRegistry} already decomposes every {@link ContractOutputType}
 * into the {@link PrimitiveType}s it is made of, so a type holding a {@code password}, a {@code
 * hash} or a {@code key} is sensitive by construction. Adding a new contract output type carrying a
 * hash makes it masked automatically, with no column, no migration and no flag to thread through
 * the output processors.
 *
 * <p>Masking is applied <b>per segment</b> rather than to the whole value whenever the composition
 * of that value is known (see {@link #VALUE_COMPOSITIONS}): a credential is handed out as {@code
 * jdoe:******}, keeping the identity of the compromised account - the actionable half - and
 * withholding only the secret. Where the composition is unknown, the whole value is masked, so an
 * omission can only ever over-mask.
 *
 * <p>Note on location: this class currently lives in {@code openaev-api}, which covers every place
 * the platform hands a value out today (finding serialization, chaining engine, attack path). If
 * masking at indexing time ever becomes necessary - so that reports and dashboards are covered too
 * - this class will have to move back down to {@code openaev-model}, because {@code FindingHandler}
 * lives there and cannot depend on {@code openaev-api}.
 *
 * <p>The database always keeps the cleartext value: deduplication, correlation and attack path
 * computation rely on it. Only the representation handed out is masked.

   * answer, as both hide the cycle instead of removing it. So the table is static, and a test walks
   * the processors to prove it never drifts from them (see {@code
   * SensitiveValueCompositionConsistencyTest}).
   *
   * <p>{@code Credentials} is emitted as {@code username:password} or {@code username:hash}
