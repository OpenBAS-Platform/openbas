/**
 * Persists a complete finding (the finding row plus its asset and tag links) in its own
 * transaction. The three statements replace a single modifying CTE that JSQLParser cannot parse, so
 * the tenant inspector can filter them once the findings table is activated. The {@code
 * REQUIRES_NEW} boundary lives here in the API layer (not on the repository) and is reached
 * cross-bean, so the new transaction actually applies.
 *
 * <p>That boundary is why {@link #saveCompleteFinding} declares a {@link TxCtx}: {@code
 * REQUIRES_NEW} suspends the caller's transaction, so the caller's scope does not travel with it
 * and the new transaction would start with {@code app.current_tenants} unset. Every read predicate
 * the inspector adds would then be false, the upsert's {@code ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE} branch
 * included, so a re-detected finding could never be updated. The scope is set by the tenant aspect
 * from that parameter, which is how the HTTP path carries a scope; the background primitive must
 * not be reachable from here.
