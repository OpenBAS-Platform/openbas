/**
 * Headless Chromium instances used for server-side report rendering.
 *
 * <p>Playwright Java is NOT thread-safe: a {@code Playwright} connection and every object created
 * from it must only ever be used by one thread (concurrent use corrupts the RPC dispatch with
 * errors like "Cannot find object to call ..."). Renders run on the renderer's small fixed thread
 * pool, so each render thread lazily gets its OWN Playwright driver + Chromium process
 * (thread-local), reused across its renders and relaunched if the browser process died. Every
 * render still gets a fresh isolated {@link BrowserContext} that is always closed.
 *
 * <p>A semaphore additionally bounds the number of simultaneous renders (and therefore of live
 * Chromium processes, since instances are per-thread and lazy) to keep memory usage predictable.
 *
 * <p>On dev machines Playwright downloads the browser bundle automatically on first use (no setup
 * needed). In the production images the bundle is pre-installed at PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH
 * (/ms-playwright) by the Dockerfiles, so no runtime download happens.
