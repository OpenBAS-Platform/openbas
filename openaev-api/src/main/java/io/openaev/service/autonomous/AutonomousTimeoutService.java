/**
 * Server-side watchdog for autonomous runs, invoked periodically by {@code AutonomousTimeoutJob}.
 * It runs two independent per-tenant sweeps:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>Deadline</b> - for each run whose OpenAEV-enforced deadline is near or passed, delegates
 *       to {@link AutonomousRunService#enforceDeadline(String, String)} to queue a winddown
 *       steering nudge (5 min / 1 min before) or hard-stop the run at the deadline (exactly like an
 *       operator Stop).
 *   <li><b>Liveness/stall</b> - for each live (RUNNING, non-plan) run, delegates to {@link
 *       AutonomousRunService#enforceLiveness(String, String)} to settle a run that has gone SILENT
 *       (no timeline heartbeat for {@link AutonomousRunService#STALL_IDLE_SECONDS}) with nothing in
 *       flight to justify the silence - a crashed / disconnected / unauthenticated orchestrator -
 *       long before its 24h deadline, while exempting a genuine {@code await_finding} park.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>This is the missing OpenAEV-side liveness guarantee: because an autonomous simulation is a
 * keep-alive chaining workflow, every native engine terminal condition (workflow END, the workflow
 * timeout job, the auto-close scheduler) is deliberately disabled for it. Without this watchdog a
 * run whose orchestrator crashes, disconnects, or never posts a terminal status would stay RUNNING
 * forever (or, before the stall sweep, until the 24h deadline).
 *
 * <p>Tenancy/transactions: the sweep is background code, so it never uses {@code @Transactional}.
 * It runs the documented per-tenant idiom - {@link TenantScopedTransaction#forEachTenant} opens one
 * scoped transaction per active tenant, and each run is enforced inside its own {@code
 * executeNew(REQUIRES_NEW)} boundary so a single failing run cannot poison the tenant's sweep. No
 * current-user / security context is required: the enforcement path performs only tenant-scoped DB
 * writes and lets the orchestrator's own next-cycle stop check tear XTM One down.
