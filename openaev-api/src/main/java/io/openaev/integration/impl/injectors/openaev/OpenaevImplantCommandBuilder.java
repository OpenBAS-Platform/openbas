  /**
   * Builds a Windows implant command that launches the implant from a detached SYSTEM scheduled
   * task instead of a direct child process, then returns the remote session immediately.
   *
   * <h4>Why a scheduled task</h4>
   *
   * EDR remote-execution channels (Palo Alto Cortex XDR Live Terminal, Microsoft Defender for
   * Endpoint Live Response) terminate the process tree of the remote session once it ends. There is
   * no Unix-style detach on Windows: a process started with {@code Start-Process} stays a child of
   * the session and dies with it. The way out is re-parenting, handing the work to a service that
   * outlives the session. The Task Scheduler service is that owner here.
   *
   * <h4>Why we no longer wait for the task to finish</h4>
   *
   * Detaching the implant protects it from session teardown, but it does not release the session.
   * This command used to poll until the task returned to {@code Ready}, which means "the payload
   * has finished", for up to five minutes. During that whole window the vendor session stayed open.
   *
   * <p>That matters because these APIs are built for an analyst typing one command and reading the
   * answer within seconds, and vendors cap the number of concurrent sessions per tenant. An Inject
   * targeting a hundred endpoints asked for a hundred simultaneous sessions held for minutes, so
   * OpenAEV was consuming a large share of that budget itself.
   *
   * <p>We now poll only until the task has actually <em>started</em>, which takes about a second,
   * then return. Execution results do not need the session: the implant posts them back over HTTP
   * through the execution callback, and nothing in OpenAEV ever reads the session output.
   *
   * <h4>Where this pattern comes from</h4>
   *
   * This mirrors {@code openaev-ttr.ps1}, the Tanium Threat Response wrapper already shipped in
   * this repository and already running at customers. It is the reference implementation for the
   * whole "return the session immediately" work: same scheduled task, same "has it started"
   * condition.
   *
   * <p>Two deliberate differences from that reference, both worth knowing:
   *
   * <ul>
   *   <li>The startup budget is 60 seconds here, against 180 in the Tanium wrapper. A task that has
   *       not started within a minute is not going to, and the point of this change is to stop
   *       holding sessions.
   *   <li>The exit code now reports whether the <em>launch</em> succeeded, not what the payload
   *       returned. The payload result was read from {@code LastTaskResult}, which is only
   *       meaningful once the task completes, and no OpenAEV code ever read it back: the five
   *       executor clients return {@code void} and no command result is ever polled.
   * </ul>
   *
   * <h4>The bootstrap signal is deliberately kept</h4>
   *
   * When the implant never starts at all (blocked download, antivirus, wrong architecture) no
   * callback is ever sent, and the session output is the only human-readable evidence left. So the
   * command still prints a one-line launch outcome before returning, exactly as the Tanium wrapper
   * does. Only the payload's own output goes away, and that was never the source of execution logs.
   *
   * <h4>Known open point</h4>
   *
   * Unregistering a task while its instance is still running is a behaviour we have only ever
   * exercised through the Tanium TTR package. The previous code never hit it, since it unregistered
   * after completion. It works in production there, but it is worth confirming per executor rather
   * than assuming.

  /**
   * Builds a Unix implant command that launches the implant fully detached from the vendor's
   * remote-execution session, then returns that session immediately.
   *
   * <h4>The problem this solves</h4>
   *
   * The generic Unix command backgrounds the implant, starts a watchdog subshell, and then blocks
   * on {@code wait $pid} for the whole Inject threshold. The vendor session stays open for that
   * entire duration. On an Inject targeting a hundred endpoints that is a hundred concurrent
   * sessions held for minutes, against APIs built for an analyst reading one answer in seconds, and
   * vendors cap concurrent sessions per tenant.
   *
   * <h4>The watchdog is kept, it moves</h4>
   *
   * The reason the wait exists is legitimate: without it an implant that hangs would sit on the
   * customer's machine forever. That safeguard is preserved here, it simply moves inside the
   * detached process instead of living in the session-bound shell. If it stayed outside, tearing
   * the session down would kill the watchdog and leave the implant running unsupervised, which is
   * strictly worse than today.
   *
   * <h4>Two details that are not decoration</h4>
   *
   * <ul>
   *   <li><b>Escape the process group.</b> {@code setsid} on Linux, a double fork through a
   *       subshell on macOS which has no {@code setsid}. Without it the payload dies when the
   *       vendor tears the session down, and detaching buys nothing.
   *   <li><b>Redirect stdout and stderr.</b> A backgrounded process holding the pipe keeps the
   *       caller waiting even with no explicit {@code wait}. The CrowdStrike unix subprocessor is a
   *       {@code base64 -d | sh} pipeline inheriting the session's stdout, so without redirection
   *       the session stays held anyway.
   * </ul>
   *
   * <h4>Where this comes from</h4>
   *
   * This is the mechanism of {@code openaev-ttr.sh}, the Tanium Threat Response wrapper already in
   * this repository and already running at customers, moved into the generated command. Tanium
   * ships it as a script the customer installs; for the other executors the customer-side scripts
   * are pure pass-throughs ({@code base64 -d | sh}), so the behaviour has to live in what we
   * generate. No customer action is required.
   *
   * <h4>The bootstrap signal</h4>
   *
   * Once detached, a failure to even start the implant produces no callback and no session output,
   * so the download is checked explicitly and the command prints a one-line outcome before
   * returning. That line is the only human-readable evidence left when nothing calls back.
