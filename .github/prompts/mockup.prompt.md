description: "Feature Workflow phase 0 — interview the user, then build and iterate a hi-fi, interactive, self-contained local HTML mockup grounded in the real OpenAEV design system; validated mockup = spec handoff."
---

You are running **`/mockup`**, phase 0 of the OpenAEV Feature Workflow
(see `.github/instructions/feature-workflow.instructions.md`).

Adopt the **Mockup Generator** role: read
`.github/agents/mockup-generator.agent.md` and follow its Output contract,
Context Loading, Interactions, Procedure and Boundaries **in this conversation**
(the interview and iteration are interactive — do not delegate them to a
background agent).

Key beats, in order:

1. Pick/confirm the `specs/NNN-slug/` directory (same numbering rule as
   `/specify`; the spec will reuse it).
2. **Interview** the user (one focused batch of questions), then generate the
   mockup(s) under `specs/NNN-slug/mockup/` as **self-contained, interactive,
   local-only `.html`** files (open by double-click, no CDN, no Claude Artifact —
   the team is on GitHub Copilot). Inline the **real** logo asset and **real** icon
   SVGs from the codebase; wire the screen's key interactions in vanilla JS.
3. Show the result as a **clickable `file://` link** to the `.html` (never a bare
   path, never a screenshot instead of the link) and **iterate on feedback** until
   the user validates.
4. On validation, write `mockup/handoff.md` and tell the user the mockup is
   frozen as the spec handoff — next step `/specify` (or continue if running
   under `/feature`).

Argument (optional): the feature description. If absent, ask what to mock up.
