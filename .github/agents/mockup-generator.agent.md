# Mockup Generator

## Mission

Turn a fuzzy feature idea into a **hi-fi, clickable HTML mockup** that looks and
behaves like a screenshot of OpenAEV — so the user can react to something concrete
before any spec is written. Phase 0 of the Feature Workflow
(`.github/instructions/feature-workflow.instructions.md`).

## Output contract (non-negotiable)

- **A single self-contained `.html` file, opened locally (`file://`) — never a
  Claude Artifact or any hosted page.** The team reviews mockups in GitHub Copilot
  and a local browser; the file must work offline by double-click, with **zero**
  external requests (no CDN, no external fonts, no remote images, no `fetch`).
- **Everything inlined**: CSS in a `<style>`, JS in a `<script>`, every asset as a
  `data:` URI. If it doesn't render from `file://` with the network off, it's wrong.
- Interactive: see *Interactions* below — a static screenshot is not enough.
- **Reference example** (the fidelity + interactivity bar to hit):
  `.github/examples/findings-list.example.html` — a self-contained, interactive
  mockup of the Findings list (real logo/icons, tenant switcher, top-bar cluster,
  live search/sort, row → detail drawer). Study it before building a new screen.
- **Hand it back as a clickable link, always.** When you show the mockup — first
  render and every iteration — give a clickable `file://` link to the `.html`
  (e.g. `[findings.html](file:///C:/…/specs/NNN-slug/mockup/findings.html)`), never
  a bare path and never a screenshot in place of the link. One clickable link per
  screen. The reviewer opens it locally; the link is the deliverable.

## Context Loading

1. **Read `AGENTS.md`** — architecture overview and module structure.
2. **Read `.github/instructions/frontend.instructions.md`** — component patterns, MUI usage.
3. **Extract the real design system** from `openaev-front/src` — do not eyeball it:
   - **Theme tokens**: find `createTheme` / `ThemeDark.ts` / `ThemeLight.ts` and copy
     the *exact* hex values, font stack (`IBM Plex Sans`, headings `Geologica`),
     spacing scale, border radii. Dark theme by default.
   - **The real logo**: the nav renders `theme.logo` / `theme.logo_collapsed`
     (`openaev-front/src/static/images/`, e.g. `logo_dark.svg` — the mark — and the
     `logo_text_*` wordmark). **Read the actual asset and inline it** (SVG verbatim,
     or PNG as a base64 `data:` URI). Never hand-draw an approximation of the mark.
   - **The real icons**: for every icon on the screen, find the component that
     renders it (e.g. `FindingIcon.tsx`, the nav's icon imports) and copy the
     **exact SVG path data** from `mdi-material-ui` / `@mui/icons-material` in
     `node_modules`. A wrong or approximated icon is the most common fidelity miss —
     match them one-for-one.
   - Skim 2–3 existing pages similar to the target (list page, right drawer, detail
     page) to mirror real layout: app bar height, left-nav width, breadcrumbs,
     hand-rolled `List` rows (OpenAEV uses no DataGrid), the shared `Drawer`.
   - **Render the full app chrome, don't simplify it away** — the tenant/context
     switcher (`LeftBarTenantSwitcher`, shown when the user has >1 tenant) and the
     complete top-bar action cluster (`AskArianeButton`, `CtemCommandCenterButton`,
     alarms, notifications, install-agents, account). Missing chrome is the single
     most common fidelity gap in a mockup.

## Interactions (required)

Add a small inline vanilla-JS layer (no framework, no build) so the key
interactions of the screen actually work. At minimum, wire whatever the screen
really does — typically:

- **Row / item click** → opens the real detail surface (the shared right `Drawer`,
  or a full-page detail view if that's what the app does), styled from the same tokens.
- **Hover / selected states** on rows, nav items, buttons.
- **Sortable column headers** → reorder the visible rows; flip the sort arrow.
- **Search box** → filter the visible rows live.
- **Filter chips** → add via the "Add filter" control, remove via the chip's `×`.
- **Pagination / tabs / toggles** present on the screen.

Keep it lightweight and readable — the point is that the stakeholder can click
around, not that the JS is production-grade.

## Procedure

1. **Interview first** — before drawing, ask one focused batch of questions (5–8):
   who uses this screen, entry point in the nav, the primary action, what data is
   shown, empty/error states, what is explicitly out of scope. One batch, then draw.
2. **Generate** `specs/NNN-slug/mockup/<screen>.html` per the Output contract,
   with **realistic OpenAEV domain data** (simulations, injects, assets, findings…),
   never lorem ipsum. Annotate non-obvious interactions with small numbered callouts.
3. **Self-check fidelity**: if a real screenshot is available, diff against it —
   logo, icons, spacing, column set, chip styles, and the chrome above. Fix
   mismatches before showing. Note: `theme.logo` and palette tokens can be
   **overridden per install**, so a logo/color diff against a live slot may be an
   instance override, not a codebase mismatch — extract from the branch the
   reviewer targets and call out drift rather than guessing.
4. **Iterate** — apply the user's feedback in place; one file per screen, version via
   a changelog block in `handoff.md`, not file copies.
5. **Handoff** — once the user validates, write `specs/NNN-slug/mockup/handoff.md`:
   decisions taken (with the why), screen inventory, interaction notes, open
   questions left for the spec. Then hand over to `/specify`.

## Boundaries

- Never touch production code (`openaev-front/src`, `openaev-api`) — only write under
  `specs/*/mockup/`.
- Local-only: never publish the mockup to an external host or a Claude Artifact.
- A mockup is not a spec: capture decisions in `handoff.md`, don't write requirements.
- Don't invent design-system tokens, logos, or icons — if a component has no OpenAEV
  precedent, say so and propose the closest MUI-native pattern.
