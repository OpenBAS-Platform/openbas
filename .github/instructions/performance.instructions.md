# Performance Conventions

## JPA & Hibernate

### N+1 Queries

- **Never** iterate a collection to call the DB in a loop — batch or join fetch instead
- Use `@Fetch(FetchMode.SUBSELECT)` on `@ManyToMany` / `@OneToMany` collections to avoid N+1
- Prefer `@Transactional(readOnly = true)` on read methods — disables dirty checking

### Fetch Strategy

- Default to `FetchType.LAZY` for all associations — only load what's needed
- `FetchType.EAGER` is acceptable only for small, always-needed collections (e.g. capabilities on a role)
- Never use `FetchType.EAGER` on collections that can grow unbounded
- For APIs returning IDs only (serialized via `MultiIdListSerializer`): LAZY + `@Fetch(FetchMode.SUBSELECT)` is enough
- Any collection that must stay EAGER (legacy serialization constraints) MUST carry `@Fetch(FetchMode.SUBSELECT)` so list loads issue one subselect instead of one query per row
- `spring.jpa.properties.hibernate.default_batch_fetch_size` is set platform-wide as a safety net against N+1 amplification — do NOT rely on it as a license to add new EAGER associations; it caps the damage, it does not remove it. Reviewers should flag any new `FetchType.EAGER` without justification

### Resolving Entity Associations from IDs

When a service receives a list of entity IDs to set as associations (e.g. role IDs on a group):
- **Never** loop with `findById()` — that's N SELECT queries
- **Use `ReferenceResolver`** (`io.openaev.utils.ReferenceResolver`):
  - 1 `COUNT` query to validate all IDs exist
  - 0 `SELECT` queries to build proxies via `EntityManager.getReference()`
  - Throws `EntityNotFoundException` with a clear message if any ID is invalid

```java
// ✅ Good — 2 queries total (1 count roles + 1 count users)
group.setPlatformRoles(
    referenceResolver.resolve(roleIds, PlatformRole.class, roleRepo::countByIdIn));
group.setUsers(
    referenceResolver.resolve(userIds, User.class, userRepo::countByIdIn));

// ❌ Bad — N queries (1 SELECT per ID)
roleIds.stream().map(tenantRoleService::findById).toList();
```

Repositories that are used with `ReferenceResolver` must expose a `countByIdIn(Set<String>)` method.

### Pagination

- All list/search endpoints MUST use pagination (`Page<T>`)
- Never return unbounded `List<T>` from an API endpoint (except for small reference data)
- Use `PaginationUtils.buildPaginationJPA()` for standard search endpoints
- Set reasonable default page size (10-20), max page size (100)

### Queries

- Prefer repository methods or `@Query` JPQL over `CrudRepository.findAll()` when filtering
- Use `existsById()` instead of `findById().isPresent()` for existence checks
- Use `@Modifying @Query` for bulk updates/deletes to avoid loading entities just to delete them, but only when the entity is not `@Indexable`, `@AuditDiffTracked`, or streamed: a native or bulk write skips the listener chain, so the index, audit, and stream are not updated (see `orm.instructions.md`). Otherwise keep the session delete or update them explicitly
- Use projections (DTO queries) for read-heavy endpoints that don't need the full entity
- Add database indexes on columns used in WHERE, ORDER BY, and JOIN conditions
- Verify with `EXPLAIN` on realistic data volumes (>= 100k rows) that new indexes are actually
  picked: a flat `OR` across joined tables or a sort on `GREATEST(a, b)` usually defeats
  single-column indexes — restructure as a `UNION` of index-backed branches instead
- Cursor/polling queries (`WHERE x_updated_at > :from ORDER BY x_updated_at LIMIT :n`) need an
  index on the cursor column

## Transactions & Network I/O

- NEVER perform network I/O (HTTP downloads, SMTP sends, Elasticsearch/OpenSearch calls, RabbitMQ
  publishes) inside a DB transaction — the connection stays held for the whole call
- Pattern: materialize data inside a short transaction (`TransactionTemplate` in Quartz jobs),
  perform the network calls outside, persist results in a second short transaction
- Cache static remote content (e.g. installer script templates) instead of re-fetching per request
- **Factory startup pattern**: when a factory must both write to DB (`@Transactional`) and upload
  to MinIO/S3, split into two methods — `initialise()` (DB-only, `@Transactional`) and
  `refreshLogo()` / `refreshAssets()` (MinIO-only, **no** `@Transactional`). The caller invokes
  `refreshLogo()` *after* `initialise()` returns so the DB transaction is already committed. Make
  the asset upload best-effort (catch + warn, don't throw).

## Scheduled Jobs & Data Retention

- High-growth tables (`execution_traces`, `injects_expectations`, `communications`, `user_events`)
  need a retention strategy before they reach tens of millions of rows — see
  `ExecutionTraceRetentionJob` for the batched-delete pattern (bounded batches, short independent
  transactions, disabled by default via configuration)
- Scheduler hot loops must not load entities per item: precompute lookup `Set`s/`Map`s, batch with
  `saveAll`, and deduplicate downstream propagation per parent (see
  `InjectExpectationService.bulkComputeTechnicalExpectations`)

## Collections & Streams

- Never materialize large collections in memory — stream and filter at the DB level
- Use `Set` instead of `List` when order doesn't matter and uniqueness is required

## REST API

- Large responses: always paginate
- Search endpoints: support filtering at DB level, not in Java
- Avoid returning deep object graphs — use DTOs with IDs, let the client fetch related entities
- File downloads: use streaming (`StreamingResponseBody`), not `byte[]` in memory

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

- ❌ Loading all entities to count them — use `repository.count()` or `COUNT()` query
- ❌ `findAll()` without pagination on tables that can grow
- ❌ Iterating a list to call `repository.findById()` in a loop — use `ReferenceResolver` or `findAllById()` instead
- ❌ Opening a transaction for read-only operations without `readOnly = true`
- ❌ Returning JPA entities with LAZY collections from `@RestController` (triggers proxy outside session)
- ❌ Performing MinIO / S3 / file I/O inside `@Transactional` — split into DB method + separate best-effort upload method called after the transaction commits
