/**
 * One entry of an autonomous run's scope: a single targetable entity, tagged by kind. The scope is
 * a heterogeneous list so an operator can mix hosts and people in one run - exactly the four kinds
 * an OpenAEV inject can target. {@code type} uses the {@code io.openaev.utils.TargetType}
 * vocabulary ({@code ASSETS}, {@code ASSETS_GROUPS}, {@code TEAMS}, {@code PLAYERS}); {@code id} is
 * the entity id of that kind (asset id / asset-group id / team id / user id).
 *
 * <p>Value-based {@link #equals}/{@link #hashCode} (on {@code type} + {@code id}) are REQUIRED, not
 * cosmetic: this type is an element of {@link AutonomousRun#getScope()}, a {@code
 * List<AutonomousScopeTarget>} mapped as a JSON column via {@code @JdbcTypeCode(SqlTypes.JSON)}.
 * Hibernate dirty-checks such a JSON attribute by comparing the current list to a deep-copied
 * load-time snapshot with {@code List.equals}, i.e. element-wise {@code equals}. With only identity
 * equality the snapshot's (freshly deserialized) elements never equal the current ones, so the
 * whole run is flagged dirty on EVERY flush and a phantom {@code UPDATE autonomous_runs} is emitted
 * even on pure reads. Under open-in-view that UPDATE is replayed during the Spring Session save at
 * response commit - outside the request's tenant scope - where it matches zero rows and blows up as
 * a {@code StaleStateException} 500 (the by-scenario read 500 and the orchestrator scope/step-write
 * 500s). Value equality keeps the list clean when nothing changed, so no phantom flush occurs.
