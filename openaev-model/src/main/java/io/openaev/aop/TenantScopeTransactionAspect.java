/**
 * Writes the tenant scope into the transaction-local {@code app.current_tenants} setting at the
 * start of each {@code @Transactional} method, so {@code can_access_tenant} filters that
 * transaction against it.
 *
 * <p>The scope is taken from a {@link TxCtx} method parameter, never from an ambient thread-local:
 * for an HTTP request the binding resolves it and passes it as an argument; background work passes
 * it explicitly. This is the deliberate v2 correction over v1, where the scope lived on the thread
 * and was lost off it. A {@code @Transactional} method without a {@link TxCtx} parameter is not
 * tenant-scoped, so the setting is left untouched and the aspect stays inert until a method opts
 * in.
 *
 * <p>{@link io.openaev.context.TxCtx.Missing} writes an empty value, which denies every row
 * (fail-closed). The value is transaction-local ({@code set_config(..., true)}): it clears itself
 * when the transaction ends and cannot leak into the next one through a reused connection.
 *
 * <p>Correctness rests on this advice running <em>inside</em> the transaction, i.e. after it has
 * begun: a transaction-local setting written before BEGIN would land in a throwaway auto-commit and
 * never reach the method. The integration test pins this down for the propagations the application
 * actually uses (REQUIRED, REQUIRES_NEW, read-only).
 *
 * <p>It must equally run <em>before</em> the RBAC aspect, which is why the order is explicit rather
 * than {@code LOWEST_PRECEDENCE}. {@code AccessControlAspect} resolves a resource's parent by
 * loading the entity itself, inside this same transaction; tied on {@code LOWEST_PRECEDENCE} the
 * two advices had an undefined relative order, and when RBAC won the tie its read ran with no
 * scope. Rows of v2-scoped tables then failed {@code can_access_tenant} (fail-closed) and were
 * hydrated as null into the persistence context, which the controller happily served afterwards -
 * an authorized user silently reading a partial entity (e.g. {@code inject_type} coming back null
 * on an atomic testing).
 *
 * <p>Within one transaction the scope is set once. A nested {@code @Transactional} method that
 * would <em>change</em> an already-set scope is refused (a programming error), while one that
 * repeats the same set of tenants is tolerated. A nested method that needs a different scope must
 * open a {@code REQUIRES_NEW} transaction.
