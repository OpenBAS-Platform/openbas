# Gap inventory — library `Paper` vs OpenAEV container surfaces

What survives here are the RULES and the measured references the code and the
render guard point at. The round-by-round narrative that produced them was cut
on 2026-08-18 — see §20 for the two rules that pruning taught.

- Product: OpenAEV, branch `fds/paper-pilot` onto `design-system/current`.
- Every value below is **measured on the installed build** and on the product's
  real components mounted in the real MUI theme (`ThemeDark`/`ThemeLight`,
  `spacing: 8`) — never read from types, changelog or docs.

---

## 5. Child paddings — the sites the "no doubling" rule covers

Read at the DOM on the real components: computed padding of the direct
children, and of the first inner row that carries one. Four families, and they
do not call for the same decision.

### 5.1 — The padding lives in the child, the Paper is at 0 (**6 sites**)

If the Paper takes a non-zero padding, the child's must go.

| site | Paper padding | measured child padding | what it carries |
|---|---|---|---|
| **L1** `LessonsObjectives.jsx:26` | 0 | `MuiListItem` **8px 16px** | MUI row gutters |
| **L3** `simulations/LessonsCategories.jsx:140` | 0 | `MuiListItem` **8px 16px** | same |
| **L4** `simulations/LessonsCategories.jsx:203` | 0 | `MuiListItem` **8px 16px** | same |
| **L6** `scenarios/LessonsCategories.jsx:115` | 0 | `MuiListItem` **8px 16px** | same |
| **L9** `simulations/Lessons.tsx:355` | 0 | `LessonsPlaceholder` **32px** | the empty state's own margin |
| **L10** `scenarios/Lessons.tsx:217` | 0 | `LessonsPlaceholder` **32px** | same |

- **L1/L3/L4/L6** — the rows carry **full-width dividers**. Removing the
  gutters and giving the padding to the Paper **pulls the dividers in too**:
  the edge-to-edge pattern disappears. That is not a padding transfer, it is a
  change of pattern. Under strict iso these four keep `padding=0` and an
  untouched child.
- **L9/L10** — clear case: the placeholder carries 32px, no divider, no side
  effect. **`LessonsPlaceholder` is a shared component** — the removal happens
  at the CALL SITE, never in the component, or its other consumers break.

### 5.2 — Doubling **already present** in the product (**1 site**)

| site | Paper padding | child padding | real horizontal total |
|---|---|---|---|
| **E3** `SectionBlock` (`EntityDetailCommon.tsx:188`) | 16px | `MuiListItem` **8px 16px** | **32px** |

The only place in the perimeter where the container's padding and the rows'
already add up, before any migration. Two of the 61 `SectionBlock` usages pass
`disablePadding` to avoid it; the others accumulate. Correcting it **would not
be iso**, so it is arbitrated separately — see §5.7.

### 5.3 — **Intrinsic** child padding, NOT to be removed (**4 sites**)

| site | Paper padding | child padding | why it stays |
|---|---|---|---|
| **L5** `simulations/LessonsCategories.jsx:306` | 16px | chips **4px 8px** | a chip's inner padding, not a container's — removing it crushes the chip |
| **L7** `scenarios/LessonsCategories.jsx:189` | 16px | chips **4px 8px** | same |
| **L8** `simulations/Lessons.tsx:152` | 16px | `HeroStat` **4px 32px 4px 4px** | the 32px on the right is the `HeroStats` divider gutter, structural |
| **E4** `DetailHero` | 16px | `HeroStat` **4px** | out of the waves, see §5.8 |

### 5.4 — Nothing to do (**3 sites**)

**L2** (ApexCharts graph: inner margins are SVG, no DOM padding to remove),
**E1** `Section` and **E2** `InformationGrid` (their `Field` children carry no
padding; E2's spacing comes from grid `gap`).

### 5.5 — Strict iso: transfer nothing

`padding={0}` on the Paper. The `MuiListItem` gutters (8px 16px) **stay**.
Reason: **the dividers must keep touching the edges** — this is the "the
padding means something" case of the general rule.

> **General rule.** When the Paper carries the padding, the children's padding
> is REMOVED — **except when that padding means something**: a full-width
> divider, a structural gutter.

Applies to L1, L3, L4 and L6: `padding={0}`, child unchanged.

### 5.6 — Transfer to the Paper, removal AT THE CALL SITE

The padding moves onto the Paper; the **32px of `LessonsPlaceholder` are
removed at the call site**. The shared component is not modified, or its other
consumers go with it. Applies to L9 and L10.

### 5.7 — Cumulated 32px on `SectionBlock`: not corrected here

A density decision of its own, taken cold, outside this wave. Converting
`SectionBlock` therefore reproduces the existing total unchanged.

| state | Paper | row gutters | horizontal total | effect on dividers |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Current** — 59 of 61 usages | 16px | 16px | **32px** | pulled in by 32px |
| **Option A** — `disablePadding` | 0 | 16px | 16px | **edge to edge** |

### 5.8 — `DetailHero` leaves the Paper waves for good

It becomes its own component. Recorded here because the code points at this
decision: two losses (accent gradient, transparent background), and the
transparent background falls under the "semi-transparent containers are a later
wave" exclusion. Listed, never converted.

---

### 5.9 An unlayered product class beats the library's padding prop

`InjectorPage.tsx` renders `<Paper padding={0} className={`paper …`}>`. It does
not render 0. `paper` is a global class in `openaev-front/src/static/css/index.css`
carrying `padding: 20px`, and it is **unlayered**, while the library ships its
utilities inside Tailwind's `utilities` layer. Unlayered CSS wins over layered
CSS whatever the specificity and whatever the source order.

Measured in the running app:

| element | rendered padding |
| --- | --- |
| `.paper` alone | 20px |
| `p-0` alone (what `padding={0}` applies) | 0px |
| `p-0 paper` | **20px** |
| `paper p-0` | **20px** |

The surface therefore renders the same 20px it rendered before the migration.
It is **iso by accident**: the prop lost the cascade, and nothing anywhere says
so — no warning, no type error, no guard, and a reader of the call site has
every reason to believe the number in the prop.

> **Rule.** A library prop that resolves to a utility class can be silently
> overridden by any unlayered product CSS on the same element. When a converted
> surface also carries a global product class, the class decides — read the
> stylesheet, not the prop. Changing the prop there changes nothing; only
> removing the class or the rule does.

This site is left as it renders. Removing `paper` from it would change the
padding on a screen this wave is not converting, which is exactly the kind of
drive-by the wave excludes.

## 10. Method — a product inventory read by name misses what it does not name

Worth writing down, because it will happen again at the next bump, OpenCTI
included.

Renaming 17 tokens left **three dead product references**, and **two were
silent**:

| reference | file | signal |
|---|---|---|
| `FDS.colors.*['--color-feedback-info-secondary-transparency']` | `ThemeDark.ts`, `ThemeLight.ts` | TypeScript error — **loud** |
| `var(--color-filigran-brand-primary-transparency)` | `TopBarIconLink.tsx` | **silent** — a `var()` hanging inside a string |
| `'bg-filigran-ia-secondary-transparency'` | `AskArianeButton.tsx` | **silent** — a utility class absent from the shipped sheet |

Neither `tsc`, nor ESLint, nor the conformity gate, nor the build says anything
about the last two. The only signal is visual, on states no screenshot of that
wave covered.

**What the inventory must look for at the next bump.** Regenerating the bridge
is necessary and not sufficient. Grep the product source — not only the
`wiredFiles` — for **both forms**:

- `var(--<token>)` inside `.ts`/`.tsx` strings, `style` objects and CSS;
- **library utility classes written as literals** (`bg-…`, `text-…`, `border-…`).

Then cross every occurrence against the tokens and utilities actually present
in the **installed** `dist/index.css` — the shipped sheet, not the source
`theme.css`. Both forms live in ordinary component files, outside the
`wiredFiles` by construction: that is exactly why they were missed. Also
recorded as LIBRARY-FEEDBACK #33.

---

## 13. The three titled wrappers adopt the library header

`EntityDetailCommon.tsx` holds three titled containers — `Section`,
`InformationGrid`, `SectionBlock` — used **106 times across 33 files**. Their
surface was already the library `Paper`; this passes the **title** into the
library's `title` slot instead of drawing it above with `SECTION_LABEL_SX`.

### 13.1 What the title becomes — measured in a real browser

|                 | before (product)             | after (library)     |
| --------------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------- |
| font            | Geologica                    | IBM Plex Sans       |
| size            | 11px                         | 12px                |
| weight          | 600                          | 400                 |
| case            | UPPERCASE (`textTransform`)  | as written          |
| letter-spacing  | 1.32px                       | 0.09px              |
| row             | 11px + `marginBottom: 12px`  | 24px, fixed height  |
| colour (dark)   | `rgba(255,255,255,0.7)`      | `rgb(175,176,182)`  |
| colour (light)  | `rgba(0,0,0,0.6)`            | `rgb(73,74,80)`     |

The number of library surfaces rendered is **identical on both sides** across
the four screens captured (5 / 11 / 6 / 8): none gained, none lost.

> This line is **evidence for this wave, not a rule**: it is the iso proof a
> reviewer may want to read while the change is under review. It records one
> measurement of one state and prescribes nothing — do not carry it forward as
> a target, and do not re-derive anything from those four numbers.

### 13.2 The flex trap — why the container becomes a grid

`style` reaches the **surface**, never the wrapper the library adds once
`title` is set. A `flex: 1` on the surface can therefore no longer stretch the
panel: the wrapper is what the product container must stretch. Measured on a
panel beside a taller one: **58px against an expected 130px**. The product
container becomes a one-row `1fr` grid — measured afterwards **268 / 268**.
Fixed product-side, with nothing asked of the library.

### 13.3 The column fix — `minmax(0, 1fr)`, not `1fr`

An **implicit** grid column is `auto`: it sizes to its content. With only the
row declared, the library wrapper measured **354px inside a 340px track** — it
overflowed by 15px and the title did not truncate, it left the panel. With
`gridTemplateColumns: 'minmax(0, 1fr)'`: wrapper **338px**, overflow **−1px**,
title ellipsized by 16px. Applied to all **three** wrappers.

### 13.4 Multilingual truncation — a KNOWN AND ACCEPTED gap

14 distinct titles reach these wrappers. Across every locale, **one** exceeds
the narrowest track `DetailSections` can produce (340px): the Spanish
*"Distribución de la puntuación total esperada por tipo de inyección"*, 66
characters, **16px cut**.

Decision: **the ellipsis is accepted**. One title in fourteen, at the narrowest
track, is no reason to shorten a translation or to compensate product-side on a
library component. The full text stays announced to screen readers. The library
does **not** expose the full title on hover when it truncates: that is
**feedback #37**.

### 13.7 Render guard

`src/__tests__/components/common/detail/EntityDetailCommonHeader.test.tsx`,
11 tests. The two checks `check-fds-conformity.mjs` runs look at imports and at
hardcoded paddings: **neither can see a header**. The guard asserts
**structure** — the title is in the header and not in the surface, no case or
font re-imposed, `flex` on the surface, grid container — never computed style,
because jsdom does not apply the library stylesheet. The pixel values are
measured in a real browser and live here, in §13.1.

## 14. Method — a surface qualifies on its ANCESTOR STACK

**Read this before any surface census, in any Filigran product. This section is
self-contained: it assumes nothing from the rest of the document.**

### The problem it addresses

Migrating a product's surfaces to the library `Paper` first means knowing
**which ones are in scope**. The perimeter is **first-level containers**: the
blocks laid on the page carrying the elevated background, of the kind a
dashboard tile is. Excluded: cards, tooltips, alerts, dialogs, popovers, menus,
autocompletes, accordions, and any surface **internal to another component**.

A census by text search gives a wrong answer, and wrong in the dangerous
direction: it lets in surfaces that have no business being there. On OpenAEV,
777 raw hits gave 395 containers then 130 in the perimeter — and **two surfaces
recommended for conversion should never have been listed**. Both times it was a
FLOATING surface.

### The rule

> **Every surface qualifies on its complete JSX ancestor stack, never on a
> window of lines. A surface carried by a floating component — tooltip, drawer,
> popover, popper, menu, dialog, autocomplete — NEVER enters the first-level
> container perimeter, whatever it looks like.**

### How to apply it

1. **Collect wide.** Search for the UI library's surface components (`Paper`,
   `Card`, `Accordion`, `Dialog`, `Popover`, `Menu`, `Drawer`, `Tooltip`,
   `Alert`…), **plus** the hand-painted surfaces: a `Box`/`div` whose style sets
   the elevated background colour. Those are invisible to any search by
   component name. On OpenAEV there were **48** of them, more than a third of
   the final perimeter.
2. **Compute each hit's ancestor stack over the whole file**, pushing opening
   tags and popping closing ones. A window of lines is not enough: a `Drawer`
   opened sixty lines above is out of reach of a forty-line window.
3. **Exclude every hit whose stack contains an open floating component.**
   Mechanical, no exceptions.
4. **Re-read by hand everything the tool classes as "convert".** On OpenAEV both
   catches came from that re-reading, not from a better-tuned detector.

### The four traps, each paid for by a real mistake

- **Do not look for a prop name, look for an ancestor.** A component paints its
  surface through `slotProps`, whose key is the name of the PART being styled:
  `slotProps={{ tooltip: { sx: { backgroundColor: … } } }}`. The word `paper`
  appears nowhere. Searching `PaperProps`/`slotProps.paper` misses it; looking
  for the `Tooltip` ancestor finds it.
- **A window of lines lies.** Moving from a 40-line window to the full stack
  took OpenAEV from 2 to 6 floating surfaces detected.
- **A hand-painted "elevated" background says nothing about the role.** The same
  `background.paper` serves page panels, chips, graph nodes and tooltip fills.
- **A role inferred from a file name is a hypothesis.** `…Panel.tsx` may be a
  page container; `…Card.tsx` may not be a card. The name orients the reading,
  it does not replace it.

### Corollary for review

When a human arbitration is needed on a surface's role, **provide the ancestor
stack rather than a screenshot**. The stack is verifiable evidence; a thumbnail
shows an appearance, and a tooltip styled as a card looks exactly like a
first-level container.

### Tool

The ancestor detector used for OpenAEV depends only on JSX structure, not on the
product: it pushes the file's opening tags and reports the hits whose stack
contains a floating component. It is reused as-is on another product by changing
the source path and the list of that UI library's floating components.

## 15. Class A — what the census got wrong about padding, and the twelve it blocks

Converting class A surfaced two defects in the census tooling and one hard
limit in the library. Recorded here because the arbitration was made on the
faulty numbers.

### 15.1 Where a padding lives decides what it means

**A padding often lives in a `makeStyles` block**, reached through
`classes={{ root }}`, not in `sx` — reading `sx` and `style` alone misses it.

**And a bare number in `sx` is not a pixel.** In MUI's `sx`, `padding: 2` means
`theme.spacing(2)` = **16px**. The interpretation depends on the source:
spacing units inside `sx`, raw pixels inside `makeStyles` or `style`.

After both fixes: **36 of the 51 convert as they stand, 15 do not.**

### 15.2 The three off-scale values — 15 → 16 and 20 → 16

`AtomicTesting.tsx:368` and `:422` carry 15px, `Policies.tsx:59` carries 20px.

**Both go to 16, the nearest value DOWNWARD**, and that is a deliberate choice
rather than a rounding rule: these three screens are dense — a remediation list
and a policy grid — and taking 20 up to 24 would add height to panels that
already scroll. Elsewhere in this migration a 12 went **up** to 16 and a 48 went
**down** to 32; the rule is not "always down", it is "whichever neighbour serves
the screen". **This is not an inconsistency to be tidied away later.**

### 15.3 The twelve asymmetric ones stay out of the wave

| padding | sites |
| --- | --- |
| `0 20px 0 0` | 9 — `ExerciseDistribution.tsx` charts |
| `20px 20px 0 20px` | 2 — `Inject.tsx:191`, `Inject.tsx:215` |
| `10px 15px 20px 15px` | 1 — `LessonsPlayer.jsx:160` |

`Paper`'s `padding` takes a single value for all four sides, so none of these
can be expressed. The workaround — `padding={0}` plus an inner wrapper — renders
identically and adds a technical level inside twelve files to satisfy a prop
signature. That is the debt this migration removes, so **they stay on MUI** until
the library can express a per-side padding. Upstream request: **feedback #38**.

### 15.4 Method — every spacing prop of an `sx` is in spacing units

A bare number in MUI's `sx` is **not a pixel**: it is multiplied by the theme's
spacing unit, 8px here. Moving an `sx` to the `style` prop — which the library
`Paper` accepts, and `sx` is not — switches to raw CSS, where the same number
means pixels. Every value moved across that boundary must be converted, or it
silently shrinks by a factor of eight.

This is not limited to `padding`. It applies to **every spacing prop**:

| in `sx` | in `style` |
| --- | --- |
| `padding` / `p` / `px` / `py` / `pt` `pr` `pb` `pl` | `padding…` in px |
| `margin` / `m` / `mx` / `my` / `mt` `mr` `mb` `ml` | `margin…` in px |
| `gap`, `rowGap`, `columnGap` | same, in px |
| `top` / `right` / `bottom` / `left` when given a bare number | same, in px |

`padding: 2` → 16px. `gap: 1.5` → 12px. `mt: 3` → 24px.

**Nothing catches this.** TypeScript accepts both forms, ESLint has no rule for
it, and a unit test on structure will not see a gutter go from 12px to 1.5px.
Only a measurement in a real browser, or reading each value at conversion time,
will.

**The rule for every remaining conversion:** before moving an `sx` to `style`,
list its properties, convert each spacing value to pixels explicitly, and check
that no property is dropped. Class G — the hand-painted `Box` surfaces — is
where this matters most: the whole `sx` moves, so every spacing value in it
crosses the boundary at once.


## 16. Two more method rules, from the hand-painted surfaces

These belong next to §14 and §15: they are what a census does not tell you, and
what the OpenCTI pilot will meet the moment it touches a surface painted by hand
rather than drawn by a `Paper`.

### 16.1 Converting a hand-painted background changes the TAG, not the style

A `Paper` → `Paper` conversion moves props between two components that both draw
a surface. A hand-painted surface is different: the colour lives in the `sx` of a
`Box`, a `div` or a `header`, and **removing that `sx` removes the surface**. The
element must become the library `Paper`.

Recorded because the mistake was made here: the `sx` of a
`<Box component="section">` was replaced with `padding={0} style={…}` and the
`Box` was left in place. The surface simply vanished — **no type error, no lint
error, no failing test**. Nothing catches it but reading the diff or looking at
the screen.

> **Rule.** For a hand-painted surface, the conversion is `<Box sx={{…}}>` →
> `<Paper padding={N} style={{…}}>` — tag included. Check the closing tag too.

The practical consequence is that these conversions cannot be scripted the way a
`Paper` → `Paper` swap can: each one is a structural edit, and each one needs its
own before/after read.

### 16.2 A conditionally painted surface has two faces

`EmptyPlaceholder` paints its border and background inside a conditional spread:

```
...(bordered ? { border, backgroundColor } : {})
```

The component renders **with or without a surface** depending on a prop. A
library `Paper` always has one, so converting it would give the bare variant a
border and a background it never had — a change in every screen that uses the
bare form.

> **Rule.** Before converting, check whether the surface is unconditional. A
> painted background behind a ternary, a spread or an `&&` means the component
> has two faces, and the conversion must be arbitrated, not assumed.

The same shape hides a second question: `SecurityDomainsModule` varies only the
**opacity** by state (`alpha(paper, hasData ? 1 : 0.5)`). That one is convertible
— its content carries the state independently, in four other places — but only
because it was checked. The test is always the same: **does anything but the
surface tell the user which state this is?**


## 17. A decided line is decided

**Cost, measured on this wave: ten approved surfaces never converted on one
side, one excluded surface converted on the other.**

### What happened

The arbitration was produced class by class, then refined **line by line**: a
role was proposed for each surface, and the reviewer confirmed or overturned it.
Several were overturned — a card that was not a card, a panel that was.

The conversion list was then built as `class == A AND role == first-level
container`. That single `AND` re-applied the inference **after** it had been
overruled. Every surface whose role had been corrected fell out of the list:

- `PlatformInfoPanel.tsx:39` and `ToolsPanel.tsx:13` — approved, not converted.
- `LessonsPreview.jsx:161` — approved, not converted.
- The whole of class C, seven surfaces — approved, never treated as a lot at
  all, because it was not class A.

Symmetrically, `Logs.jsx:211` had been held out of the waves under the
"clickable card" motif, recorded in LIBRARY-FEEDBACK #35. It reappeared in a
later census under a fresh identifier, its role read as a plain container, and
it was converted. The technical argument was sound — the `Paper` contains the
`ButtonBase` rather than being it — but the line had already been decided, and
re-opening it was not the converter's call.

### The rule

> **A decided line is decided.** Build the work list **from the decisions**,
> never from the categories that produced them. Categories exist to present a
> choice; once the choice is made they carry no authority, and intersecting them
> with a decision means re-arbitrating after the arbiter.
>
> **Recognise an excluded surface when it returns under another number.** Cross
> the work list against every earlier exclusion **on `file:line`**, never on the
> identifier, and redo that crossing before each lot.

### Why the identifier is not enough

Identifiers were regenerated by a sort whose key included the recommendation, so
any reclassification shifted them: one surface moved from `S087` to `S085`
between two runs. They are now frozen on `file:line`. But even frozen, an
identifier says nothing about *which screen* a reviewer had in mind: the
exclusion of `DetailHero` was given by name, months of context before it
resurfaced as `S105` in an approval list. **Names travel; numbers do not.**


## 18. Measurement traps, for whoever verifies a library bump

Three ways a measurement lied during this migration. Each cost a wrong
conclusion that had to be retracted.

### 18.1 A `Chip` is measured on its inner span, not on its root

All sixteen chip variants reported `font-size: 16px` — the value inherited from
the page, read off the chip's root element. The text lives in an inner `<span>`,
where the real value is 14px, and where the bumped variant drops to 12px.

> **Rule.** Walk to the node that actually carries the text — the first text
> node's `parentElement` — and read the computed style there. A uniform value
> across every variant of a component is the signature of reading a container
> that inherits, not the component.

### 18.2 `.focus()` does not trigger `:focus-visible`

Focusing an element programmatically reports no focus ring, because
`:focus-visible` only matches keyboard-driven focus. A first pass concluded the
converted accordion had lost its focus indicator. Tabbing to it for real showed
the indicator intact, and `Mui-focusVisible` applied.

> **Rule.** Any focus-appearance check is done by pressing Tab until the element
> is reached, never by calling `.focus()`.

And once there: act on the element that **actually has focus**
(`document.activeElement`), not the one queried beforehand. Reading
`aria-expanded` off a different accordion produced a second false negative.

### 18.3 Compare colours normalised, not as strings

Six "discrepancies" between a measured background and its token were the same
colour written two ways: the DOM returns `#ffffff`, the token is declared
`#fff`. Expand three-digit hex and lowercase both sides before comparing.

### The general shape

All three share one form: **the measurement was taken on the wrong node, in the
wrong state, or in the wrong representation** — and each time the wrong answer
looked plausible enough to report. A measurement that contradicts an expectation
deserves a second reading of the method before it is announced as a finding.


## 19. One file, two surfaces: the import breaks and only the typechecker sees it

**Three occurrences in a single day**, on `TenantParameters.tsx`,
`ReportingForm.tsx` and `GettingStartedHero.tsx`.

### The shape

A file holds two container surfaces: one is converted to the library `Paper`,
the other stays on MUI — because it is a real link, a click target, or a surface
the arbitration held back. Importing the library component under its own name
then collides with the MUI one:

```
import { Paper } from '@filigran/design-system';
import { Box, Paper, Typography } from '@mui/material';   // Duplicate identifier
```

**ESLint reports nothing.** No rule covers a duplicate import binding here, and
the file lints clean. `tsc` is the only thing that catches it —
`TS2300: Duplicate identifier 'Paper'` — and a second error follows on the
untouched site, because its `variant="outlined"` no longer type-checks against
the library's props.

### The remedy

Alias the library import and rename only the converted usage:

```
import { Paper as FdsPaper } from '@filigran/design-system';
import { Box, Paper, Typography } from '@mui/material';
```

`<FdsPaper>` for what was converted, `<Paper>` for what stays. **Rename the
closing tag too** — the opening and closing tags are edited separately, and a
`<FdsPaper>` closed by `</Paper>` is a different error again.

### The operating rules

> **Convert a file whole, never site by site.** A partial pass leaves the MUI
> import in place for the remaining sites and produces the collision.
>
> **Run the typechecker after each file, not at the end of the lot.** Lint is
> not a substitute: it passed on all three.
>
> **Before converting, count the container surfaces in the file** and check
> whether any of them is out of the wave. If so, plan the alias from the start
> instead of discovering it from a type error.


### 19.1 In a `.jsx` file, not even the typechecker sees it

The library's `IconButton` takes its content through an **`icon` prop**, not
through children: it renders `<span aria-hidden>{icon}</span>` after spreading
`...props`, so a child passed the JSX way is not just ignored — it is
overwritten.

Written as `<IconButton size="sm">{<Add />}</IconButton>` in a `.jsx` file, the
result is a button of the right size, in the right place, clickable, focusable
— **and completely empty**. ESLint passes. The typechecker passes too, because
the file is `.jsx`: it has no props to check. The unit suite passes, because
nothing asserted that control's content. It was caught by measuring the
rendered page and finding no `<svg>` inside the button.

An icon-only button also has no accessible name once the icon is
`aria-hidden`. That is true of the MUI original too and is not introduced
here, but it is a real defect and it deserves its own fix rather than a silent
one inside a container wave.

### 19.2 The base is what you WRITE, the alias is what you READ

The design system exposes the same colour under three names, and which one is
correct depends entirely on the direction of travel.

| name | shape | write | read |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `--token-layer-N` | per-layer BASE, undiluted | **yes** | no |
| `--token-layer-N-transparency-15` | diluted variant | no | **no** |
| `--token` | per-layer alias | no | **yes**, inside `.layer-N` |

**Writing** — a host overriding a colour targets the per-layer BASE, because
the library's own dilution is declared on top of it and must keep applying.
`AppThemeProvider` does this for a customer's `paper_color`.

**Reading** — a product painting a surface with a library colour targets the
ALIAS, because the base alone is undiluted: measured `rgb(43, 79, 141)` opaque
against the Paper's 15%. The alias resolves to the diluted per-layer value and
carries no percentage in its name.

Never the diluted variant, in either direction. Its opacity is part of its
identifier, so changing the opacity renames it — the library has done this once
already, 40% to 15%. And an unresolvable `var()` does not fall back to a wrong
colour: it invalidates the whole declaration. Measured, a `border` shorthand
naming a token that no longer exists computes to **`0px none`** — the border
vanishes, with no type, lint, build or guard error.

## 20. Two rules for pruning this document

Learned while cutting 888 lines out of it.

### 20.1 Numbers are addresses, not a table of contents

Sections keep their number for ever, even when the ones before them are
removed. The gaps left behind cost nothing; renumbering would break every
`§13.2` written in a code comment, in a commit message already pushed, or in a
feedback entry. **Never renumber. Fold a surviving rule into another section and
give it a fresh sub-number there.**

### 20.2 A section the code cites is never round memory

The first pass of this cut classified §6 — a section number that no longer
exists, and is named here only to tell the story — as "conversion arbitrations
for a bump that happened", and marked it for deletion. Its heading said exactly that. But
its three sub-sections carried standing rules, and **seven code comments pointed
at them** — deleting the section would have left those comments addressing
nothing.

> **Before cutting a section, grep the source tree for its number.** A citation
> from the code is proof the section still serves someone: it is the reader of
> that comment, tomorrow, following the pointer.

The same pass found §4, likewise gone, in the same position, for one line that
records why `DetailHero` stays out of the waves. Both were folded into §5 instead of being
dropped, and the seven comments were re-addressed in the same commit — a cut
that breaks what it claims to preserve is not a cut, it is a regression.


## 21. Header-row controls take the library's 24px size; nothing else moves

The library `Button` measures **24px** at `size="sm"` — exactly the height of
the `Paper` header row. A header action has to use it: anything taller
overflows the row and eats into the 8px gap to the surface below.

`ButtonCreate`, the product's shared creation button, is used **52 times**. It
renders MUI's `size="small"`, which measures **31px in the running app** — MUI
computes 40px and a `MuiButton` override in `ThemeDark`/`ThemeLight` brings it
down. Only the **three** call sites that sit in a header row opt into the
library button, through a `size="sm"` prop. **The other 49 keep their exact
current rendering.**

The rule is the ROW, not the component. `ButtonCreate` is not the only control
a header slot receives: `LessonsCategoryAddTeams` puts an icon button there,
and MUI's `size="small"` renders it at **30px** — over the row by six. It takes
the library `IconButton` at `size="sm"` (`h-6 w-6`) instead. Any control landing
in a header row has to be checked against 24px, whatever component it is.

> **How to find them, and how this census got it wrong.** Measuring the code is

The controls known to be over the row, and not moved by this wave:

| site | control | height | why it stays |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `Channel.tsx` — Dark theme logo tile | `ChannelAddLogo` | 31px | MUI `size="small"` IS the small size; reaching 24px means the library button — Button wave |
| `Channel.tsx` — Light theme logo tile | `ChannelAddLogo` | 31px | same |

Both sit in a **product-drawn** row that imitates the library header — a 12px
label over an 8px gap — rather than in a library one, so they are not header
actions in the sense above. They are recorded here so the next census does not
have to rediscover them.

> not control sizes.

Recorded because the reflex is to "finish the job" and convert all 51 at once,
and because the 31px figure is easy to get wrong: the bench renders 40px, the
app renders 31px, and only the second is what a reviewer sees.


## 22. A composite typography class is used whole, never as its parts

The library's `Paper` puts its header typography on the row as **one** class:

```
content-compact text-default-secondary
```

Not as the four utilities that look equivalent —
`text-content-compact font-content-compact leading-* tracking-*`. The library's
own comment records why, and it is worth repeating product-side because the
mistake is invisible:

> Those four carry font-SIZE, font-FAMILY, line-height and letter-spacing — **no
> weight**. The `@utility content-compact` block carries all five. Left on the
> four-class form, the title inherits its weight from whatever wraps it:
> measured at 700 inside a `font-weight: 700` ancestor, against the node's 400.

The library paid for this twice before writing it down. A product that
reproduces a library header — see `components/common/LibHeaderRow.tsx` — must
copy the composite class, and its guard asserts the split form is absent:

```
expect(row.className).not.toMatch(/\btext-content-compact\b/);
```

> **Rule.** When copying typography from the design system, copy the class the
> system composes, never the utilities it decomposes into. The decomposition
> loses whatever the composite adds — here, the weight — and it loses it
> silently, because every other property still matches.

## 23. A section title and a column header are not the same object

The mixing criterion this wave ended on is **not** "no mixed row" but "no
visible mixing on one screen": the eye does not compare by row, it compares
what it sees at once. Applying it turned up four remaining product-styled
labels on the timeline screen — `Scheduled`, `Up next`, `In flight`,
`Completed`. They were deliberately **left alone**, and the reason has to
survive this document, because the next reader will see four product titles
next to a library one and reach for the same fix twice.

They are a different object.

| | section title | column header |
|---|---|---|
| position | **above** the surface, or in its header slot | **inside** the surface, below its edge |
| carries | the section's name | a name **plus** an icon, a count, and an accent |
| background | the surface's own | a tinted band, `alpha(accent, 0.05)` |
| separator | none — the surface's border does the work | its own `border-bottom` |
| what the library offers | `Paper`'s `title` / `action` slots | nothing equivalent |

`ExecutionBoard.tsx`'s `BoardColumn` is the single point that draws the three;
`ExecutionHero.tsx`'s `Scheduled` is not even a header but a **status badge
label**, which the mixing probe reports only because its typography matches.

Aligning them on the library header means dropping the tinted band, the icon
and the count, or reimplementing all three around a slot that was not built to
hold them. That is a **redesign**, and a redesign is a decision for whoever
owns the timeline — not a side effect of a consistency pass.

> **Rule.** Convert or align what the library has a slot for. When the product
> object carries something the slot cannot hold — an icon, a count, a tinted
> band — the honest answer is to leave it and say so, not to shed the parts
